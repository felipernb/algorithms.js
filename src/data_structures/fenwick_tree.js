/**
 * Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
 *
 * The fenwick tree is a tree in the sense it represents a structure where
 * the leafs are the original array values and each parent has the sum of its
 * two children. E.g., for an array [1, 2, 3, 4], we have:
 *
 *    10
 *  3    7
 * 1 2  3 4
 *
 * But some nodes aren't really important. In fact every right child isn't
 * needed to compute the prefix sum (as its value is just the parent's value
 * minus the left child), so we can store the tree in a compact array structure
 * like this:
 *
 * 1 3 3 10
 *
 * Here we assume all the operations will be on a 1-based array for two
 * reasons: (1) the bit operations become rather easy and (2) it's better to
 * reason about the range sum (prefix(b) - prefix(a-1)) on a 1-based array.

      In the array, to know where a index is in the tree, just look at where is
      the rightmost bit. 1 is a leaf, because the rightmost bit is at position 0.
      2 (10) is 1 level above the leafs. 4 (100) is 2 levels above the leafs.

      Going up the tree means pushing the rightmost bit far to the left. We do
      this by adding only the bit itself to the index. Eventually we skip
      some levels that aren't represented in the array. E.g. starting at 3 (11),
      it's imediate parent is 11b + 1b = 100b. We started at a leaf  and skipped
      the level-1 node, because it wasn't represented in the array
      (a right child).

      Note: (index&-index) finds the rightmost bit in index.

      The key here is to sum every node that isn't in the same subtree as an
      already seen node. In practice we proceed always getting a node's uncle
      (the sibling of the node's parent). So, if we start at the index 7, we must
      go to 6 (7's uncle), then to 4 (6's uncle), then we stop, because 4 has
      no uncle.

      Binary-wise, this is the same as erasing the rightmost bit of the index.
      E.g. 7 (111) -> 6 (110) -> 4 (100).

      Note: (index&-index) finds the rightmost bit in index.
